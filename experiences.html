      <h1>Encounters Within the Psychedelic Landscape</h1>
      <h2 class="experiences-subheader">Each journey is unique. But recurring patterns reveal the architecture of the inner world. The psychedelic state does not create hallucinations—it reveals the mind stripped of its filters.</h2>

      <h3>The Nature of the Experience</h3>
      <p>Psychedelic experiences are not predictable, repeatable events. They are emergent responses to internal conditions—psychological, emotional, and spiritual. Set (your mindset), setting (the environment), and substance interact to create a space where perception, emotion, and identity can undergo radical shifts.</p>
      <p>While no two journeys are identical, certain phenomena consistently arise. We prepare you for the possibility—not the guarantee—of these encounters.</p>

      <h3>Common Psychedelic Phenomena</h3>
      <ol class="phenomena-list">
        <li>
          <img src="assets/experiences/time.png" alt="Time perception" class="phenomenon-img" />
          <h4>1. Altered Sense of Time and Space</h4>
          <p>Time may stretch, loop, dissolve. Physical boundaries dissolve. A minute can feel like a lifetime.</p>
          <p><em>Purpose:</em> Breaks attachment to control, invites surrender.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="assets/experiences/visual.png" alt="Visual perception" class="phenomenon-img" />
          <h4>2. Visual and Auditory Shifts</h4>
          <p>Geometric patterns, color trails, enhanced perception of sound. Eyes closed: inner landscapes and symbolic visions.</p>
          <p><em>Purpose:</em> Aesthetic layer of the subconscious rising to the surface.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="assets/experiences/emotions.png" alt="Emotional release" class="phenomenon-img" />
          <h4>3. Emotional Catharsis</h4>
          <p>Grief, laughter, rage, love—often arising without external cause.</p>
          <p><em>Purpose:</em> Release and integration of repressed material.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="assets/experiences/ego.png" alt="Ego dissolution" class="phenomenon-img" />
          <h4>4. Ego Dissolution</h4>
          <p>Loss of sense of "I". No boundaries between self and other. Awareness persists without identity.</p>
          <p><em>Purpose:</em> Freedom from habitual narratives; glimpse of non-dual consciousness.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="assets/experiences/entities.png" alt="Entity encounters" class="phenomenon-img" />
          <h4>5. Encounters with Archetypes or Entities</h4>
          <p>Some report meeting guides, ancestors, animals, or “presences.”</p>
          <p><em>Purpose:</em> Psychological projection, symbolic integration, or contact—interpretation varies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="assets/experiences/past.png" alt="Past memories" class="phenomenon-img" />
          <h4>6. Re-experiencing Past Events</h4>
          <p>Childhood memories, past traumas, or forgotten sensations may emerge.</p>
          <p><em>Purpose:</em> Allows for reframing, understanding, or resolution.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="assets/experiences/Insights.png" alt="Insight and realization" class="phenomenon-img" />
          <h4>7. Insights and Realizations</h4>
          <p>Sudden clarity about relationships, behavior patterns, fears, life direction.</p>
          <p><em>Purpose:</em> Cognitive restructuring through direct awareness.</p>
        </li>

      <p>Both are valid. Both are part of the path. Our role is to hold the container—so you can explore safely, knowing someone is there, not to steer, but to witness.</p>

      <h3>After the Trip – Integration</h3>
      <p>Psychedelic states may last hours. Their echoes last years. Without integration, even the most profound journey fades into abstraction. We help translate your experience into meaning and action, whether through structured dialogue, creative expression, or embodied practice.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="experiences-section">
      <h3>A Note on Expectations</h3>
      <p>There is no guarantee of insight. Some trips are gentle. Some are silent. Some are void. The experience cannot be forced. It must be met with humility, patience, and respect.</p>
