      <h3>Who I Am</h3>
      <p>My name is Guido Theelen. I walk with those who are ready to explore the hidden chambers of their consciousness—those who seek truth not in abstraction, but in direct experience.</p>
      <p>I am both software developer and bushcraft practitioner. I work at the intersection of structure and surrender, logic and intuition. My life’s path has taught me to navigate complexity—technological, psychological, and spiritual.</p>
      <p>Guiding psychedelic experiences is not a profession. It is a vocation. One born from direct contact with the transformative power of plant medicines and the responsibility they demand.</p>

      <h3>My Approach</h3>
      <div class="core-principles">
        <div class="principle">
          <h4>Presence Over Prescription</h4>
          <p>I do not interpret your experience. I witness, I anchor, I reflect only when invited. The wisdom lies within you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle">
          <h4>Safety Through Structure</h4>
          <p>Every journey is preceded by rigorous screening, preparation, and clarity. I hold the container firmly—so you can let go fully.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle">
          <h4>Integration as the Real Work</h4>
          <p>The trip is only the threshold. What you build with what you see—that’s the work we do together afterward.</p>

      <h3>Training and Experience</h3>
      <ul class="training-list">
        <li>Years of direct experience with psilocybin, San Pedro, cannabis, and other plant teachers</li>

        <li>Workshops given on AI, human cognition, and self-reflection</li>
        <li>Personal meditation and somatic disciplines</li>
        <li>Ongoing study in the ethics and neuropsychology of altered states</li>

    <section class="guide-section">
      <h3>Why I Guide</h3>
      <p>I guide because I’ve seen what happens when people are left to interpret the ineffable alone. I guide because transformation is not safe in the abstract—it requires space, stillness, and someone to hold the edges.</p>
      <p>I do not claim to heal. I create the space where healing becomes possible.</p>

      <h3>What You Can Expect from Me</h3>
