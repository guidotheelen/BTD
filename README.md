# Beyond the Doors

This repository contains the source for the "Beyond the Doors" static site. The project explores psychedelic journeys and includes pages describing the mission, methods, a preparation guide, and ways to get in touch.

## Pages

The site is made up of several HTML pages:

- **index.html** – landing page with a brief introduction
- **mission.html** – outlines the vision behind the project
- **methods.html** – explains the approach and stages of the journey
- **experiences.html** – showcases transformative experiences
- **guide.html** – offers preparation and integration tips for journeys
- **contact.html** – provides contact information
- **location.html** – shows where our retreats take place

Each page includes a shared navigation banner at the top so visitors can easily move between sections.

## Viewing Locally
