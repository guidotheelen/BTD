# Beyond the Doors

This repository contains the source for the "Beyond the Doors" static site. The project explores psychedelic journeys and includes pages describing the mission, methods and ways to get in touch.

## Pages

The site is made up of several HTML pages:

- **index.html** – landing page with a brief introduction
- **mission.html** – outlines the vision behind the project
- **methods.html** – explains the approach and stages of the journey
- **experiences.html** – showcases transformative experiences
- **contact.html** – provides contact information

Navigation between these pages is handled by **banner.js**, which injects a common banner at the top of each page.

## Viewing Locally

Because the site is purely static, you can open any of the HTML files directly in your web browser. Simply double-click a page or use `File -> Open` in your browser to view it.
